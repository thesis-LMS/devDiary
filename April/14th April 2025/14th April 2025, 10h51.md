## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin `bookservice.kt` implementation using qodo (IntelliJ idea plugin).
- target `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created new branch for qodo development.
- set up `bookservice.kt` shell.
- selected `bookservice.kt` and `bookservicetest.kt` as context in qodo ide plugin.
- prompt for `addbook`: "implement `addbook` method in `bookservice` based on the tests in `bookservicetest.kt`."
- qodo (using default llm) generated the code. integrated. test passed.
- prompted for `getbookbyid` (with tests in context). qodo generated code using `resourcenotfoundexception` correctly. tests passed.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo's issue of "often does not show the result" happened right away. had to retry the prompt for `addbook`.
- ensuring the correct files are selected in qodo's context window within the IDE.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- retrying the prompt for `addbook` eventually worked.
- `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods implemented with qodo.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `getallbooks` and `updatebook` methods in `bookservice` using qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the ide integration of qodo is convenient for context when it's responsive.
- the unresponsiveness/need to retry is a definite friction point.
- qodo's understanding of tests (benefit) helped it pick the right exception for `getbookbyid`.
- still no kdocs.
