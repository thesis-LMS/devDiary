## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `getallbooks()` and `updatebook()` methods in `bookservice` using qodo.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `getallbooks` (tests in context). generated simple `return bookrepository.findall()`. tests passed.
- prompted qodo for `updatebook`. its first attempt was a bit basic.
- refined prompt: "for `updatebook`, ensure it fetches the book by id, updates its properties from the input, saves, and returns. handle `resourcenotfoundexception`."
- qodo generated a better version. integrated.
- during `updatebook` generation, qodo suggested a change to an assertion in `bookservicetest.kt` to "simplify the test logic". i rejected this change.
- tests for `updatebook` passed after ensuring only the service code was accepted.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo trying to modify the test file for `updatebook`. this is the "as a tool made primarily for testing, it often tries to modify the tests" issue. required vigilance.
- the first `updatebook` suggestion was too simplistic.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- iterative prompting for `updatebook`.
- explicitly rejected test file modifications suggested by qodo.
- `getallbooks` and `updatebook` implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `deletebookbyid` method using qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo's ide context helps it understand custom exceptions and method calls from tests.
- however, its tendency to want to change tests is problematic for strict tdd. the developer must be the gatekeeper.
