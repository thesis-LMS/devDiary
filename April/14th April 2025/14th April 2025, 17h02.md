## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `deletebookbyid(id: uuid)` method in `bookservice` using qodo.
- start implementing `searchbooks` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `deletebookbyid`. it generated correct logic using `existsbyid` and `deletebyid`, with `resourcenotfoundexception`. tests passed.
- started on `searchbooks`. prompted qodo with context of `bookservice.kt` and `bookservicetest.kt` (search tests): "implement `searchbooks` method based on the tests for title, author, and availability searches."
- qodo provided code for individual parameter searches.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- `deletebookbyid` was smooth.
- for `searchbooks`, qodo's initial output covered single parameters. the combined criteria will need another prompt.
- qodo interface was unresponsive once, had to restart the prompt/generation.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- restarted qodo generation for `searchbooks`.
- got a starting point for `searchbooks`.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- refine `searchbooks` with qodo for combined criteria.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the intermittent unresponsiveness of qodo is a consistent issue.
- its ability to "understand tests" (benefit) helps it get method names and basic logic right from the context.
