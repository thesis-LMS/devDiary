## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `searchbooks` implementation in `bookservice` using qodo.
- ensure all crud and search tests in `bookservicetest.kt` pass.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- refined prompt for `searchbooks`: "ensure `searchbooks` also handles combined title, author, and available parameters, calling the correct repository method. provide a default empty list return."
- qodo generated the combined logic. the structure was okay.
- integrated. one of the repository method calls it suggested for a combined search was slightly different from my interface (e.g. param order). manually corrected the service call to match my `bookrepository` interface.
- all `searchbooks` tests now pass.
- ran all crud and search related tests in `bookservicetest.kt` - all pass.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo suggested a slightly different method signature for a combined search repository call than what i had defined. this is like the "llms modifying tests/contracts" issue, but for repository interfaces.
- it also suggested a minor refactor to a search test's assertion message, which i ignored.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manually aligned the service's call to the existing repository interface method.
- ignored test modification suggestions.
- crud and search parts of `bookservice` are complete with qodo.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `borrowbook` logic in `bookservice` using qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo's ide context is a double-edged sword: it sees the tests so it "understands" them, but also feels empowered to suggest changes to them.
- the "often does not show result" or "small token size" feeling might be why sometimes suggestions are incomplete or slightly off for complex methods, requiring iterative prompting or manual fixes.
- day 1 for `bookservice` with qodo (crud/search) done.
