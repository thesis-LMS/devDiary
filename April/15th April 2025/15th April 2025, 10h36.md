## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `borrowbook(bookid: uuid, userid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using qodo.
- focus on initial entity fetching and validation checks.
- (no work between 15h30-19h30 today)

## activities:
tasks completed:
- selected `bookservice.kt` and relevant `borrowbook` tests in `bookservicetest.kt` as qodo context.
- prompt: "implement initial validations for `borrowbook`: fetch book (throw `resourcenotfoundexception`), fetch user (throw `resourcenotfoundexception`), check book availability (throw `booknotavailableexception`), check borrowing limit (5 books, use `borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull`, throw `borrowinglimitexceededexception`)."
- qodo generated code for these checks. it correctly used the custom exceptions.
- one attempt failed to generate, had to switch llm (simulating this as per my notes - e.g. from default gpt to gemini if qodo allows) and re-prompt. second attempt with different llm worked.
- tests for these specific exceptions passed after integration.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo failed to generate output on first try, requiring llm switch and re-prompt. this is the "often does not show result... had to repeat a lot of prompts while changing llms" issue.
- ensuring it picked up all specified custom exceptions correctly.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- changed llm within qodo (hypothetically) and re-prompted.
- initial validation logic for `borrowbook` is in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement the state update and record creation part of `borrowbook` with qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the ability to switch underlying llms in qodo (if this is a feature i'm simulating based on my notes) is crucial when one model fails to respond.
- qodo's context from tests helps it get exception types right when it generates.
