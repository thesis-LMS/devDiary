## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete the `borrowbook` method in `bookservice` using qodo: book state updates and `borrowingrecord` creation.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo (with context): "continue `borrowbook`: after validations, update book (set available=false, set borrowedbyuserid, set duedate to 2 weeks from now). save book. create and save `borrowingrecord`. return updated book."
- qodo generated the code.
- date logic (`localdate.now().plusweeks(2)`) was correct.
- `borrowingrecord` instantiation was mostly correct, one field name was slightly off from my model, manually corrected.
- qodo also suggested a change to a `borrowbook` test to "make it more resilient to date changes". declined.
- all `borrowbook` tests now pass after the minor manual fix.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- minor discrepancy in a field name for `borrowingrecord` from qodo's suggestion.
- qodo again trying to modify a test. this is becoming a very consistent behavior with this tool.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual correction of the field name.
- rejected test modification.
- `borrowbook` method is complete with qodo.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `returnbook` method using qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo can generate complex sequences of operations, but small details in object instantiation might need checking.
- the "tries to modify tests" is a significant characteristic of qodo. it seems to prioritize what it thinks is a "better" test over strictly adhering to the existing one as a specification for code generation.
