## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `returnbook(bookid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using qodo.
- focus on initial fetches and checks. (working after the 15h30-19h30 restriction).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- selected relevant `returnbook` tests and `bookservice.kt` as qodo context.
- prompt: "implement initial validations for `returnbook`: fetch book (throw `resourcenotfoundexception`), then fetch active `borrowingrecord` by bookid with null returndate (throw `bookalreadyreturnedexception` if none)."
- qodo generated this logic. output was missing for a moment, then appeared.
- integrated. tests for these exceptions passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- slight delay/hiccup in qodo generating the output, but it came through without needing a re-prompt this time.
- it correctly used the specified exceptions.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- waited a moment for qodo output.
- initial validation for `returnbook` is working.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (tomorrow, wednesday) implement state updates, record updates, and late fee calculation for `returnbook` with qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo's understanding of the test context (e.g., which repository method to call for "active borrowing record") is a plus.
- the intermittent generation delays are still present.
