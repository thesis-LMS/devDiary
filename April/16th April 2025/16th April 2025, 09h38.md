## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue `returnbook` method in `bookservice` with qodo: state updates and `borrowingrecord` update (return date).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo (with context): "continue `returnbook`: after validations, update book state (available=true, clear borrowedbyuserid, clear duedate), save book. update `borrowingrecord` by setting returndate to `localdate.now()`."
- qodo generated this part.
- one of the generated lines was java syntax (`booktoreturn.setavailable(true);`) instead of kotlin property access, even though context is kotlin. manually changed to `booktoreturn.available = true`.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #bug_fixing #qodo
## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo suggesting java setter syntax instead of kotlin property access. this is the "suggesting java instead of kotlin" issue.
- it also suggested a small change to the `returnbook_shouldupdatebookavailability...` test's assertions regarding the order of checks, which i declined.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manually corrected to kotlin property access.
- declined test change.
- book and record state updates (pre-fee) for `returnbook` are in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement late fee calculation in `returnbook` with qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the java/kotlin syntax mix-up can happen with qodo's underlying llms. ide context doesn't always prevent it.
- qodo's persistence in suggesting test changes is notable.
