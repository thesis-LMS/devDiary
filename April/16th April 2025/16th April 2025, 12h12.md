## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement late fee calculation in `returnbook` with qodo.
- complete and test `returnbook` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo: "finally, in `returnbook`, calculate late fee: if returndate > duedate, fee = (days between duedate and returndate) * 0.5. set fee on `borrowingrecord`. save record. return book."
- qodo generated the late fee logic. the `chronounit.days.between()` was correct.
- integrated. all `returnbook` tests passed.
- ran all tests in `bookservicetest.kt` - all green! `bookservice` is complete with qodo.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo's suggestion for late fee calculation was accurate this time.
- no attempt to change tests in this specific generation.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `bookservice.kt` is functionally complete with qodo.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start `userservice.kt` implementation with qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `bookservice` with qodo is done. the experience was mixed: ide context is good, but unresponsiveness and test modification suggestions are drawbacks.
- the "benefit" of it trying to understand tests can be helpful for getting method calls right, but needs to be managed.
