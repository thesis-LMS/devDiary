## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `userservice.kt` using qodo.
- target `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `userservice.kt` shell.
- selected `userservice.kt` and `userservicetest.kt` as qodo context.
- prompted for `registeruser`. qodo generated it. test passed.
- prompted for `getuserbyid` (specifying `resourcenotfoundexception`). qodo generated it. tests passed.
- qodo was responsive for these simpler methods.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none for these. `userservice` methods are straightforward.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` in `userservice` done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `updateuser` in `userservice` with qodo. then start `bookcontroller.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo handles simple crud generation well when it's responsive and has clear test context.
- the "tries to understand tests" benefit shines here as it uses the correct exceptions.
