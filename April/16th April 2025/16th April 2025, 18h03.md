## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `userservice.kt` by implementing `updateuser` with qodo.
- begin `bookcontroller.kt` implementation: `addbook` endpoint.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `userservice.updateuser`. generated correctly. tests passed.
- `userservice.kt` is fully implemented with qodo.
- created `bookcontroller.kt` shell.
- selected `bookcontroller.kt` and `bookcontrollertest.kt` (for `addbook`) as qodo context.
- prompt: "implement `addbook` spring boot kotlin controller method using `bookservice`. return 201 created with location header."
- qodo generated the method. its location header was a simple string concat.
- asked qodo to refine: "use `servleturicomponentsbuilder` for the location header." qodo updated it correctly. test passed.

 #implement_functions #ai_tool #bug_fixing #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo's first attempt at controller location header was too basic, needed refinement.
- it did not suggest changing controller tests for this.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- iterative prompt for location header.
- `userservice` complete. `bookcontroller.addbook` drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (tomorrow, thursday) continue `bookcontroller` with qodo.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo can take refinement prompts for specific framework features like spring's uri builder.
- the ide context helps it know about `bookservice` for the controller.
