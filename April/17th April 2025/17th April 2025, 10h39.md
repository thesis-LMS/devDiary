## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `getbookbyid` and `getallbooks` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using qodo.
- (no work between 15h30-19h30 today)

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `bookcontroller.getbookbyid` (with tests in context, specifying 404 handling). generated try-catch correctly. tests passed.
- prompted qodo for `bookcontroller.getallbooks`. generated simple service call. tests passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo was responsive and accurate for these.
- it correctly inferred the exception-to-http-status mapping from the test context or prior examples.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `getbookbyid` and `getallbooks` controller endpoints implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `updatebook` and `deletebookbyid` endpoints in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- when qodo is working smoothly and has good test context, it's quite effective for generating these controller methods that wrap service calls.
