## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `updatebook` and `deletebookbyid` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using qodo.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `bookcontroller.updatebook` with 404 handling. generated. tests passed.
- prompted qodo for `bookcontroller.deletebookbyid` with 204/404 handling. generated. tests passed.
- qodo suggested a test change for `deletebookbyid`'s test, "to verify the service method was called an exact number of times". declined, as current test just checks status.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo again suggesting a test modification, this time for verification style.
- otherwise, generation was fine.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- rejected test change.
- crud endpoints (except search/borrow/return) for `bookcontroller` done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `searchbooks` endpoint in `bookcontroller`. (will do this after 19h30)

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the "qodo wants to refactor your tests" theme is very strong. it's not just about fixing them if they fail with its code, but proactively suggesting changes to perfectly good tests.
