## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `borrowbook` endpoint in `bookcontroller.kt` using qodo.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `borrowbook` controller method, specifying exception-to-http-status mapping (404 for notfound, 409 for unavailable/limit).
- qodo generated the try-catch structure.
- one of the generated catch blocks was for a generic `exception`. had to ask it to refine to catch specific exceptions like `booknotavailableexception`.
- after refinement, tests passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- qodo's first attempt at exception handling for `borrowbook` was too generic.
- it also tried to "optimize" a test by removing an assertion, which i rejected.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- refined prompt for specific exception handling.
- rejected test modification.
- `borrowbook` controller endpoint done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `returnbook` endpoint. complete `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- even with ide context, qodo sometimes needs explicit prompting for detailed exception handling in controllers.
- its desire to "improve" tests is relentless.
