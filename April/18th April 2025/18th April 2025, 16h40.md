## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `usercontroller.kt` implementation (`getuserbyid`, `updateuser`) using qodo.
- wrap up coding for qodo phase.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted qodo for `usercontroller.getuserbyid` (with 404 handling). generated. tests passed.
- prompted qodo for `usercontroller.updateuser` (with 404 handling). generated. tests passed.
- `usercontroller.kt` is fully implemented with qodo.
- ran all service and controller tests: `mvn clean test -dtest=*servicetest, *controllertest`. all pass.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #qodo

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- `usercontroller` methods were straightforward for qodo.
- one instance where qodo suggested a java annotation (`@getmapping(value="/{id}")`) instead of just `@getmapping("/{id}")` in kotlin. minor manual fix.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual syntax correction.
- all backend code for qodo phase is functional and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- wrap-up for qodo phase: review, manually add kdocs/comments, ktlint, reflections.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo phase coding complete. the experience was very reliant on its responsiveness and managing its test modification suggestions.
- the ide context is its main strength.
- the "java instead of kotlin" for minor syntax can still occur.
