## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- wrap-up for qodo phase: review code, add kdocs/comments manually, run ktlint, final reflections.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- reviewed all services and controllers generated with qodo's help.
- manually added kdoc stubs to all public methods in all four files.
- added a few inline comments, especially where qodo's generation might have been a bit dense or to explain why a test modification was rejected.
- ran `mvn ktlint:format`. it fixed a fair number of spacing issues and some import orders. qodo's default formatting wasn't always ktlint compliant.
- ran `mvn clean test` - all passed.
- reflected on qodo experience:
    - pros: ide context is powerful for understanding tests/existing code; "tries to understand tests" can lead to correct method calls. option to switch llms (simulated) was a vital workaround for unresponsiveness.
    - cons: "often tries to modify tests" (major issue for tdd); "often does not show result" / unresponsiveness requiring retries/llm switches; can suggest java syntax; no docs/comments.
    - overall: potentially useful if its quirks are managed, but the test modification suggestions are a serious concern for a tdd workflow.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ktlint found more issues in qodo-assisted code than in claude-assisted code, but less than raw chatgpt.
- documenting around the "why i rejected qodo's test change here" was a new type of comment.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- ktlint fixes and manual documentation.
- qodo development phase complete.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- all ai tool development phases are complete. next is data analysis (chapter 5: results).

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo's unique selling point (deep test understanding via ide) is also its biggest current hurdle if it leads to unwanted test modifications.
- the unresponsiveness would be a major productivity killer in a real project if not for workarounds like switching the underlying LLM
- the "no kdocs/readme" and "ktlint fixes needed" are standard post-ai tasks.
