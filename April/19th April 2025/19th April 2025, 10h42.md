## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin `bookservice.kt` implementation using github copilot (pro student version).
- target `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created new branch for copilot development.
- set up `bookservice.kt` shell with repository injections.
- typed `addbook(newbook: book): book` method signature. copilot immediately suggested the `return bookrepository.save(newbook)` implementation. accepted it. test passed.
- typed `getbookbyid(id: uuid): book` signature. copilot suggested fetching and then `orelsethrow { nosuchelementexception() }`.
- manually changed `nosuchelementexception` to my project's `resourcenotfoundexception("book with id $id not found")`. tests for `getbookbyid` passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot suggested a generic java exception instead of my custom kotlin one for `getbookbyid`.
- inline suggestions are fast, but require immediate review for project-specific details.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual correction of the exception type.
- `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods implemented quickly with copilot.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `getallbooks` and `updatebook` methods in `bookservice` using copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot's inline suggestions are very responsive. good for boilerplate.
- still need to guide it for custom exceptions or project conventions.
- no kdoc suggestions, just as seen with chatgpt.
