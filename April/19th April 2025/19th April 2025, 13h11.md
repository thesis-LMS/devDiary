## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `getallbooks()` and `updatebook()` methods in `bookservice` using copilot.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `getallbooks(): list<book>` signature. copilot suggested `return bookrepository.findall()`. accepted. tests passed.
- typed `updatebook(id: uuid, updateddetails: book): book` signature. copilot provided a decent initial implementation: fetch, update properties, save.
- reviewed copilot's `updatebook` suggestion. it correctly handled fetching and throwing `resourcenotfoundexception` if absent. property updates were mostly direct.
- one of its suggestions for updating a field was slightly verbose; used copilot chat to ask "can you suggest a more concise way to update the properties of 'existingbook' from 'updateddetails' in kotlin?" the chat offered a slightly cleaner approach for one of the lines.
- tests for `updatebook` passed after minor integration.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot's inline `updatebook` was good, but copilot chat helped refine a small part of it. this is the "one llm model picks up garbage/suboptimal code from another" benefit.
- ensuring all properties were updated correctly as per test expectations.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- used copilot chat for refinement of a specific code block.
- `getallbooks` and `updatebook` implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `deletebookbyid` method using copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the combination of inline suggestions and copilot chat seems powerful. chat can be used for more targeted questions or refactoring ideas on copilot's own inline suggestions.
- still, the developer is the one guiding and making final decisions.
