## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `searchbooks` implementation in `bookservice` using copilot.
- ensure all crud and search tests in `bookservicetest.kt` pass.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- stopped using the chat. 
- continued with `searchbooks`. for the combined criteria (title, author, available all present), copilot suggested calling the correct long repository method name.
- reviewed the overall if/else if structure suggested by copilot. it was mostly logical. added a final `else { emptylist() }`.
- all `searchbooks` tests now pass.
- ran all crud and search related tests in `bookservicetest.kt` - all pass.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot occasionally suggested a java stream api call for filtering, had to manually ensure it stayed with kotlin collection functions or direct repository calls as intended by tests.
- one of copilot's suggestions for a search condition implied a slight change in how a test was structured (e.g. expected an empty list vs. a specific exception not covered by my current tests for that specific combo). i stuck to implementing for the existing tests. this is the "copilot tries to alter test logic" issue.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- ignored suggestions that deviated from current test specifications or kotlin idioms.
- focused on making existing tests pass.
- crud and search parts of `bookservice` are complete with copilot.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `borrowbook` logic in `bookservice` using copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot can build up complex conditional logic effectively, but review is needed to ensure it aligns with specific project patterns and test expectations.
- the "suggesting test alterations" tendency needs active filtering.
- day 1 for `bookservice` with copilot (crud/search) is done. feels efficient for these parts.
