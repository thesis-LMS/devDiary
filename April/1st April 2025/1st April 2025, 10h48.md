## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin `bookservice.kt` implementation using chatgpt.
- target `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created a new branch for chatgpt development.
- set up `bookservice.kt` shell.
- gave chatgpt an overview of the project along with the requirements analysis
- copied `addbook_shouldsaveandreturnthenewbook()` test into chatgpt and gave a prompt
- chatgpt provided code. manually fixed package declaration and a couple of imports. ran test, passed.
- copied `getbookbyid` tests (found and notfound) to chatgpt. prompted for implementation.
- integrated code. had to explicitly tell it to use my `resourcenotfoundexception` as it defaulted to a generic one. tests passed after this.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- chatgpt's generated code had incorrect package (`com.example...`) and missed some project-specific imports. manual correction needed.
- it initially used `nosuchelementexception` for `getbookbyid` instead of my custom `resourcenotfoundexception`.
- the copy-pasting of individual tests is a bit fiddly.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manually corrected package/imports.
- refined prompt for `getbookbyid` to specify the exception type.
- `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods implemented with chatgpt.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `getallbooks` and `updatebook` methods in `bookservice` using chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- chatgpt is fast for generating initial method structures based on tests.
- need to be very specific in prompts, especially regarding custom classes or exceptions.
- the "incorrect package/imports" issue is an immediate overhead.
