## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `deletebookbyid(id: uuid)` method in `bookservice` using chatgpt.
- start implementing `searchbooks` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `deletebookbyid` tests to chatgpt. it generated the correct logic using `existsbyid` and `deletebyid`, including the `resourcenotfoundexception`. tests passed.
- started on `searchbooks`. decided to try providing the whole `bookservicetest.kt` section for `searchbooks` to give more context, as copying individual tests for all search combinations would be too much.
- prompted: "implement the `searchbooks` method in kotlin for spring boot based on these tests..." (pasted relevant test methods).
- chatgpt provided an implementation for `searchbooks` covering individual parameter searches.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- "copying and pasting tests individually to chatgpt was a little cumbersome, so i ended up copying and pasting the whole test file (or large sections)" - this was the motivation for `searchbooks`.
- the initial `searchbooks` implementation from chatgpt only handled single parameters well, not the combined one yet.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `deletebookbyid` was straightforward with chatgpt.
- got a starting point for `searchbooks` handling individual criteria.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- refine `searchbooks` with chatgpt to handle combined criteria and ensure all search tests pass.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- providing more context (more tests) to chatgpt seems to help for more complex methods like `searchbooks`, but context window limits could be an issue for very large test files.
- it's still a process of prompting, integrating, testing, and refining.
