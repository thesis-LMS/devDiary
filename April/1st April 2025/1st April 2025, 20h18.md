## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `searchbooks` implementation in `bookservice` using chatgpt.
- ensure all crud and search tests in `bookservicetest.kt` pass.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- refined prompt for `searchbooks`: "please ensure the `searchbooks` method also handles the case where title, author, and available are all provided, calling the `findbytitlecontainingignorecaseandauthorcontainingignorecaseandavailable` repository method."
- chatgpt updated the `searchbooks` implementation with the combined criteria logic.
- integrated the code. had to manually adjust the order of some if/else if conditions for optimal logic flow and add a default `else { emptylist() }`.
- all `searchbooks` tests now pass.
- ran all crud and search related tests in `bookservicetest.kt` - all pass.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- chatgpt's conditional logic for `searchbooks` wasn't perfectly ordered initially.
- sometimes it suggested a java-style try-with-resources or stream api usage, had to gently nudge it back to idiomatic kotlin.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual refactoring of the conditional block in `searchbooks`.
- specific reminders in prompts about kotlin.
- crud and search parts of `bookservice` are complete with chatgpt.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `borrowbook` logic in `bookservice` using chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- chatgpt can generate complex conditional logic, but it often requires manual review and refactoring for optimal structure and correctness.
- the "java-isms" can creep in if not careful with prompting or if the problem is complex.
- day 1 for `bookservice` with chatgpt is done for crud/search.
