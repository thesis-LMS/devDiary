## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `borrowbook(bookid: uuid, userid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using copilot.
- focus on initial entity fetching and validation checks.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `borrowbook` signature.
- copilot suggested fetching book and user, then checking `book.isavailable`.
- it correctly suggested throwing `resourcenotfoundexception` for missing book/user.
- for availability, it suggested a simple `if (!book.isavailable) throw illegalargumentexception("book not available")`. manually changed to `booknotavailableexception`.
- for borrowing limit, i typed a comment `// check borrowing limit (max 5) using borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull`. copilot then suggested the correct if condition using this repository call and throwing `illegalstateexception("limit exceeded")`. manually changed to `borrowinglimitexceededexception`.
- tests for these specific exceptions are passing.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot defaults to generic exceptions (`illegalargumentexception`, `illegalstateexception`) more often than chatgpt did for business rule violations. requires manual change to custom exceptions.
- providing a comment hint helped it generate the borrowing limit check correctly.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual correction of exception types.
- using comments as prompts for more complex logic segments.
- initial validations for `borrowbook` are in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement the state update and record creation part of `borrowbook` with copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot's suggestions are quick but often need refinement for project-specific exceptions.
- using comments as "prompts" for inline suggestions is an interesting interaction pattern with copilot.
