## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete the `borrowbook` method in `bookservice` using copilot: book state updates and `borrowingrecord` creation.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- after the validation checks, typed comments for next steps: `// update book: set available false, set borrowedbyuserid, set duedate +2 weeks`. copilot suggested the property updates.
- typed `// save book`. copilot suggested `bookrepository.save(booktoborrow)`.
- typed `// create and save borrowingrecord`. copilot suggested instantiation of `borrowingrecord` and saving it.
- had to manually adjust the `duedate` calculation (`localdate.now().plusweeks(2)`) as copilot's initial suggestion was a bit off.
- also tweaked the `borrowingrecord` instantiation to ensure all fields matched my model and test expectations.
- all `borrowbook` tests now pass.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot's date logic and precise object instantiation for `borrowingrecord` needed manual correction.
- it sometimes generates code that would require a new field on a model, or a slightly different method signature for a repository, effectively suggesting a change to the "requirements" defined by existing interfaces/tests. had to ignore these and stick to the plan.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual corrections for date and object creation.
- consciously avoided letting copilot's suggestions alter pre-defined interfaces or test expectations.
- `borrowbook` method is complete with copilot.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `returnbook` method using copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot is very good at "filling in the blanks" when guided by comments.
- however, for details like specific date calculations or complex object initializations, manual review and adjustment are often necessary.
- the "suggesting changes to existing contracts/tests" is a recurring theme with ai tools when the path of least resistance for *them* is to change the spec.
