## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `returnbook(bookid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using copilot.
- focus on initial fetches and checks. (working outside the 15h30-19h30 restriction now).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `returnbook` signature.
- copilot suggested fetching the book and then the active borrowing record (`borrowingrecordrepository.findbybookidandreturndateisnull`).
- it correctly suggested throwing `resourcenotfoundexception` if book is missing, and `bookalreadyreturnedexception` if no active record is found.
- accepted these suggestions. tests for these specific exceptions passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #copilot

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none significant for these initial checks. copilot picked up the pattern from `borrowbook` and the repository method names well.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- initial validation for `returnbook` is working.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement book state update, record update, and late fee calculation for `returnbook` with copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot seems to learn from the coding patterns within the same file or session. its suggestions for `returnbook` validations were more aligned with project specifics than `borrowbook`'s initial ones.
- generates KDoc!
