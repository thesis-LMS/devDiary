## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue `returnbook` method in `bookservice` with copilot: state updates and `borrowingrecord` update (return date).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- after validation checks in `returnbook`, typed comments:
    - `// update book state: available true, clear borrowedbyuserid, clear duedate`
    - `// save book`
    - `// update borrowingrecord: set returndate to now`
- copilot provided correct suggestions for these steps.
- integrated the code.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot initially suggested setting `borrowingrecord.returndate = localdate.now()` before calculating late fees. this is correct, as fee calc depends on return date.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- accepted copilot's logical sequencing.
- book and record state updates (pre-fee) for `returnbook` are in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement late fee calculation in `returnbook` with copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- guiding copilot with comments for sequential steps in a complex method works well.
- it can often infer the correct objects and properties to update from context.
