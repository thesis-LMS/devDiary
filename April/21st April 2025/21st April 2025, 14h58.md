## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `userservice.kt` using github copilot.
- target `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `userservice.kt` shell with `userrepository` injection.
- typed `registeruser(newuser: user): user` signature. copilot suggested `return userrepository.save(newuser)`. accepted. test passed.
- typed `getuserbyid(id: uuid): user` signature. copilot suggested fetch and `orelsethrow { resourcenotfoundexception(...) }`. accepted (after checking exception message matched test). tests passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #copilot

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none for these simple methods. copilot handled them perfectly and quickly.
- it picked up the custom `resourcenotfoundexception` pattern from `bookservice` or the tests.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` in `userservice` done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `updateuser` in `userservice` with copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- for straightforward crud in a new service, after having done similar patterns in `bookservice`, copilot is extremely efficient.
- it seems to learn/adapt to patterns used within the current project/session.
