## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `userservice.kt` by implementing `updateuser` with copilot.
- start `bookcontroller.kt` implementation.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `updateuser(id: uuid, updateddetails: user): user` signature in `userservice`. copilot suggested the full logic: fetch, update properties, save, with correct exception handling. accepted. tests passed.
- `userservice.kt` is now fully implemented with copilot.
- created `bookcontroller.kt` shell with `bookservice` injection.
- asked copilot chat to make sure all the tests in `bookcontrollertest` are green
- copilot suggested the `bookcontroller` service. test didn't pass.

- 

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- continue `bookcontroller` with copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot significantly sped up `userservice` implementation.
- will have to look at a different model to make sure the tests pass. maybe time for gemini?
