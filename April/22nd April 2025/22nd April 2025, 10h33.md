## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `getallbooks` and `updatebook` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using copilot.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `@getmapping fun getallbooks(): list<book>` signature. copilot suggested `return bookservice.getallbooks()`. accepted. test passed.
- typed `@putmapping("/{id}") fun updatebook(@pathvariable id: uuid, @requestbody booktoupdate: book): responseentity<book>` signature.
- copilot suggested the try-catch for `bookservice.updatebook` returning ok/notfound. accepted. test passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot's suggestions for these were accurate and followed the established patterns. no significant issues.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `getallbooks` and `updatebook` controller endpoints implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `deletebookbyid` and `searchbooks` endpoints in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the controller implementation with copilot is very fast for these crud-like endpoints that map closely to service methods.
- its context awareness within the file is strong.
