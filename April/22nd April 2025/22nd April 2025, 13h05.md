## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `deletebookbyid` and `searchbooks` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using copilot.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `deletebookbyid` signature. copilot suggested try-catch calling service, returning `nocontent` or `notfound`. accepted. test passed.
- typed `searchbooks` signature with `@requestparam` annotations. copilot suggested calling `bookservice.searchbooks` and returning the list. accepted. tests passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #copilot

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- for `searchbooks`, copilot correctly inferred to pass through the optional params to the service.
- no issues.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `deletebookbyid` and `searchbooks` controller endpoints implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `borrowbook` and `returnbook` endpoints in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot handles methods with multiple optional request parameters well by passing them through to the service call.
- most of `bookcontroller` is now done.
