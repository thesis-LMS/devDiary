## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `borrowbook` and `returnbook` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using copilot.
- complete `bookcontroller.kt`. (working after the 15h30-19h30 restriction)

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `borrowbook` signature. copilot suggested the try-catch block, catching `resourcenotfoundexception` (for 404), `booknotavailableexception` (for 409), and `borrowinglimitexceededexception` (for 409). this was very accurate. accepted. tests passed.
- typed `returnbook` signature. copilot suggested try-catch for `resourcenotfoundexception` (404) and `bookalreadyreturnedexception` (409). accepted. tests passed.
- `bookcontroller.kt` is now functionally complete with copilot.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- copilot's suggestions for the multi-exception handling in `borrowbook` controller were surprisingly good and matched the test expectations for status codes.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- accepted copilot's good suggestions.
- `bookcontroller` complete.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (tomorrow, friday) implement `usercontroller.kt` with copilot. then wrap-up phase.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot's ability to suggest the correct multiple catch blocks and map them to appropriate http status codes (404 vs 409 conflict) for the borrow/return endpoints was impressive. it seems to have learned the pattern well from the service layer or existing controller tests.
