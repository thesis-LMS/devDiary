## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `usercontroller.kt` by implementing `updateuser` with copilot.
- all backend code for copilot phase should then be functional.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- typed `updateuser` signature in `usercontroller`. copilot suggested the try-catch logic calling `userservice.updateuser` and returning ok/notfound. accepted. tests passed.
- `usercontroller.kt` is now fully implemented with copilot.
- ran all service and controller tests for the project: `mvn clean test -dtest=*servicetest, *controllertest`. all pass.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #copilot

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none for `updateuser`; copilot handled it well.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- all backend services and controllers implemented with copilot, all tests pass.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- wrap-up for copilot phase: review code, manually add kdocs/comments, run ktlint, final reflections.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the core coding with copilot was significantly faster than manual, especially for the simpler `userservice` and `usercontroller`, and for the repetitive parts of `bookcontroller`.
- `bookservice` still required more interaction (comments as prompts, chat for refinement) but was faster than pure manual.
- the "no kdocs/style adherence" is consistent.
