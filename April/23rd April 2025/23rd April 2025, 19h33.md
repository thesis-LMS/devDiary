## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- run ktlint on copilot-generated codebase, fix style issues.
- add any necessary inline comments.
- final test run. reflections on copilot phase.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- ran `mvn ktlint:format`. it fixed a number of spacing and import order issues.
- manually adjusted a few long lines that ktlint couldn't auto-fix.
- added a few inline comments to `bookservice.borrowbook` and `returnbook` to clarify specific logic steps that copilot generated.
- ran `mvn clean test` - all passed.
- reflected on copilot experience:
    - pros: very fast for boilerplate and well-patterned code, good context awareness within a file, chat feature useful for refinement.
    - cons: still suggests generic exceptions, can try to alter test logic, no docs/comments, kotlin/java syntax mix-ups less frequent than chatgpt but still occasionally for annotations.
    - overall effort: faster than manual and chatgpt for raw code generation, but review, specific prompting (via comments/chat), and manual additions (docs, style, custom exceptions) still required.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ktlint fixes were necessary, confirming ai doesn't always follow style guides.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- ktlint and manual style fixes.
- copilot development phase complete.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (next week) begin phase 5: development with claude.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- copilot feels like a true "assistant" - it speeds things up but doesn't replace the need for developer oversight and quality control.
- the "altering test logic" suggestion is a key thing to be vigilant about with copilot, more so than with chatgpt where i was explicitly feeding it tests as a spec. copilot sometimes seems to try to "help" by simplifying the problem, which might involve changing the test's implied requirements.
- the benefit of "one llm model picks up garbage code created by the other llm model" (inline vs chat) was observed and helpful.
