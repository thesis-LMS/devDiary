## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `borrowbook(bookid: uuid, userid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using chatgpt.
- focus on initial entity fetching and validation checks (book exists, user exists, book available, borrowing limit).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided relevant `borrowbook` tests (happy path, book not found, user not found, not available, limit exceeded) to chatgpt.
- prompt: "implement the `borrowbook` method in kotlin for spring boot. it needs to: 1. fetch book by id (throw resourcenotfound if not found). 2. fetch user by id (throw resourcenotfound if not found). 3. check if book is available (throw booknotavailableexception if not). 4. check user's borrowing limit (currently 5, throw borrowinglimitexceededexception if at limit using `borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull`)."
- chatgpt generated code for these initial checks.
- integrated and fixed package/imports.
- tests for these specific exceptions started passing.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #bug_fixing #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- chatgpt initially missed the call to `borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull` and tried to manage limit with a non-existent field on user. had to reprompt specifically for that repository call.
- ensuring it used the correct custom exception types and messages.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- specific re-prompt about the borrowing limit check method.
- added details about exception messages in prompts.
- initial validation logic for `borrowbook` is in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement the state update and record creation part of `borrowbook` with chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- for multi-step logic with specific repository calls, chatgpt needs very explicit instructions.
- it's good at generating the try-catch or conditional throwing of exceptions once told what they are.
