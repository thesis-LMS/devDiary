## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete the `borrowbook` method in `bookservice` using chatgpt: book state updates and `borrowingrecord` creation.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- prompted chatgpt: "continue `borrowbook`: after validations, update the book (set available=false, set borrowedbyuserid, set duedate to 2 weeks from now). then save the book. then create and save a new `borrowingrecord` with bookid, userid, borrowdate (now), duedate. return the updated book."
- chatgpt generated the code for these steps.
- integrated. had to manually adjust the `duedate` calculation (`localdate.now().plusweeks(2)`) as it initially used a less precise method.
- fixed how it instantiated `borrowingrecord` to match my model's constructor.
- all `borrowbook` tests now pass.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- chatgpt's date logic needed correction.
- constructor for `borrowingrecord` was slightly different in its suggestion.
- one instance where chatgpt suggested modifying the test to simplify the code it generated. had to explicitly tell it to adhere to the existing test. this is the "llms modifying tests" issue.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual correction of date logic and object instantiation.
- reiterated that tests are fixed and code must adapt.
- `borrowbook` method is complete with chatgpt.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `returnbook` method using chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- chatgpt can generate the sequence of operations for complex methods, but details like date manipulation or exact object creation often need manual oversight.
- the tendency to suggest test changes is a real concern for tdd.
