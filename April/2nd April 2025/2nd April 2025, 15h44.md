## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `returnbook(bookid: uuid): book` method in `bookservice` using chatgpt.
- focus on initial fetches and checks (book exists, active borrowing record exists).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided relevant `returnbook` tests (happy path, book not found, already returned) to chatgpt.
- prompt: "implement `returnbook` in kotlin spring boot. 1. fetch book by id (throw resourcenotfound if not). 2. fetch active `borrowingrecord` by bookid where returndate is null (using `borrowingrecordrepository.findbybookidandreturndateisnull`). if no active record, throw `bookalreadyreturnedexception`."
- chatgpt generated this initial validation logic.
- integrated and fixed usual package/import issues.
- tests for these specific exceptions passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #bug_fixing #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- making sure chatgpt used the correct repository method `findbybookidandreturndateisnull` and the right exception `bookalreadyreturnedexception`.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- specific prompting for repository method and exception type.
- initial validation for `returnbook` is working.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement book state update, record update, and late fee calculation for `returnbook` with chatgpt.
- limit reset

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- breaking down the implementation request for chatgpt into smaller, logical chunks (validations first, then actions) seems to yield better results for complex methods.
