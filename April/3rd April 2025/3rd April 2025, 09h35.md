## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `userservice.kt` using chatgpt.
- target `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `userservice.kt` shell.
- provided `registeruser` test to chatgpt. prompted for implementation. integrated, fixed package/imports. test passed.
- provided `getuserbyid` tests (found/not found) to chatgpt. prompted, specifying `resourcenotfoundexception`. integrated, fixed imports. tests passed.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- the usual package/import corrections for chatgpt-generated code.
- `userservice` is much simpler, so chatgpt handled these methods very easily.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual fixes for package/imports.
- `registeruser` and `getuserbyid` in `userservice` done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `updateuser` in `userservice` with chatgpt.
- then start `bookcontroller.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- for simple crud like in `userservice`, chatgpt is very fast at generating the core logic, with the main overhead being integration fixups.
- the "cumbersome copy-pasting of individual tests" is less of an issue for smaller test files like `userservicetest.kt`.
