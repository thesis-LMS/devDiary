## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `getbookbyid` and `getallbooks` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using chatgpt.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `getbookbyid` controller tests (found/not found) to chatgpt.
- prompt: "implement `getbookbyid` controller method. it calls `bookservice.getbookbyid`. handle `resourcenotfoundexception` from service by returning http 404."
- chatgpt generated the try-catch block and `responseentity.ok/notfound`. integrated, fixed imports. tests passed.
- provided `getallbooks` controller test. prompted for implementation.
- chatgpt generated `return bookservice.getallbooks()`. integrated. test passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring chatgpt correctly mapped the service's `resourcenotfoundexception` to an http 404 status in the controller.
- it sometimes forgets to make the controller method a `public fun` (kotlin default) and might use java syntax if not explicitly reminded for kotlin in context of spring annotations.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- clear instructions on exception-to-status mapping.
- manual check for kotlin syntax.
- `getbookbyid` and `getallbooks` controller endpoints implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `updatebook` and `deletebookbyid` endpoints in `bookcontroller` with chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the "java instead of kotlin" for annotations or small syntax details is a recurring minor friction point.
