## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `updatebook` and `deletebookbyid` endpoints in `bookcontroller.kt` using chatgpt.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `updatebook` controller tests. prompted chatgpt for implementation with exception handling for 404. integrated. tests passed.
- provided `deletebookbyid` controller tests. prompted for implementation (expecting 204 or 404). integrated. tests passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- for `deletebookbyid`, ensuring chatgpt returned `responseentity.nocontent().build()` for success and `responseentity.notfound().build()` for failure.
- it occasionally tried to make the service call and then check for null, instead of catching the exception from the service. had to clarify the service already throws an exception.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- specific prompts about expected status codes and the service's exception behavior.
- crud endpoints for `bookcontroller` are mostly done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `searchbooks`, `borrowbook`, `returnbook` endpoints in `bookcontroller` with chatgpt.
- wait for the limit reset
