## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `searchbooks` endpoint in `bookcontroller.kt` using chatgpt.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `searchbooks` controller tests to chatgpt.
- prompt: "implement `searchbooks` controller method with optional request params: title, author, available. it calls `bookservice.searchbooks` and returns the list."
- chatgpt generated the method with `@requestparam(required = false)` annotations.
- integrated. tests passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring it used `required = false` for all optional parameters. its first attempt missed it for one.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- quick prompt refinement: "make sure all requestparams are optional".
- `searchbooks` controller endpoint implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `borrowbook` endpoint in `bookcontroller` with chatgpt.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- chatgpt handles straightforward parameter mapping from controller to service well.
- small details like `required = false` can be easily missed by the ai if not explicitly part of the test context it's given or the prompt.
