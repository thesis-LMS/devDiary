## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `borrowbook` endpoint in `bookcontroller.kt` using chatgpt.
- complete `bookcontroller.kt`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `borrowbook` controller tests (success 200, book/user notfound 404, notavailable/limitexceeded 409 conflict).
- prompt: "implement `borrowbook` controller method. it calls `bookservice.borrowbook`. handle `resourcenotfoundexception` (404), `booknotavailableexception` (409), and `borrowinglimitexceededexception` (409)."
- chatgpt generated the try-catch structure with multiple catches.
- integrated. one of the exception mappings to status code needed a slight tweak to match test exactly. tests passed.
- `bookcontroller.kt` is now functionally complete with chatgpt.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- chatgpt sometimes uses a generic `exception` catch or a less specific http status if not explicitly told which service exception maps to which http status.
- it also suggested a test modification for one of the 409 error messages. declined and clarified the expected behavior.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- detailed prompt about exception-to-status mapping.
- reiterated that tests are the source of truth.
- `borrowbook` controller endpoint done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `returnbook` endpoint in `bookcontroller` to finalize it. then start `usercontroller.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the "LLMs modifying tests" observation is persistent. requires vigilance.
