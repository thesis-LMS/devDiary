## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `usercontroller.kt` implementation (`getuserbyid`, `updateuser`) using chatgpt.
- all backend code for chatgpt phase should be functional.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- provided `usercontroller.kt` controller test file to chatgpt. prompted for implementation with 404 handling. integrated. tests passed.
- `usercontroller.kt` is now fully implemented with chatgpt.
- ran all service and controller tests for the project: `mvn clean test -dtest=*servicetest, *controllertest`. all pass.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #ai_tool #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- `usercontroller` methods were straightforward for chatgpt given their simplicity and similarity to `bookcontroller` crud.
- the main "challenge" is the repetitive nature of fixing small things like package names or slight syntactic preferences chatgpt might have.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manual micro-corrections.
- all backend services and controllers are now implemented using chatgpt and all tests pass.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- wrap-up for chatgpt phase: review code, run ktlint, final reflections.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the core coding for the lms backend using chatgpt is complete in about 4 days.
- the process was very interactive, with a lot of prompt-integrate-test-refine cycles.
- the "no kdocs/readme/style adherence" means there's a necessary manual cleanup phase. a phase i am not interested in.
