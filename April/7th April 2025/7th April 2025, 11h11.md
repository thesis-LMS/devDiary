## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- wrap-up for chatgpt phase: code review of services (`bookservice`, `userservice`).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- read through `bookservice.kt` generated with chatgpt's help.
- read through `userservice.kt` generated with chatgpt's help.

## tags:
 #docs #refactor #ai_tool #chatgpt

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- the code generated by chatgpt, while functional, sometimes lacks the nuanced structure or variable naming a human might choose. decided not to do major refactoring, just ensure correctness and add docs.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- focused on documenting the ai-generated code as-is, after validation by tests.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the "no kdoc" observation for llms is very real. this is a clear gap where human effort is still fully required if documentation is valued.
