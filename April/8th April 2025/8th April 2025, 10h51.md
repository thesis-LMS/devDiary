## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin `bookservice.kt` implementation using claude (free tier, sonnet 3.7).
- target `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created new branch for claude development.
- set up `bookservice.kt` shell.
- uploaded `bookservicetest.kt` to claude.
- prompt: "implement the `addbook` method in the provided kotlin spring boot `bookservice` to pass the relevant tests from `bookservicetest.kt`. it uses `bookrepository`."
- claude provided a clean implementation for `addbook`. integrated. test passed.
- prompted for `getbookbyid` similarly, specifying use of `resourcenotfoundexception`. claude generated correct code. tests passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- deciding how much of the test file to upload for context. the "cannot upload a lot of files at once in the free plan" is a consideration. for these initial simple methods, uploading just the relevant test methods and the service shell worked.
- claude's interface for uploading/providing context is different from just pasting into chatgpt or copilot's inline nature.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- started with smaller context uploads.
- `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods implemented with claude.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `getallbooks` and `updatebook` methods in `bookservice` using claude.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- claude's ability to handle uploaded files (even slightly larger ones) is a good way to provide context.
- the initial suggestions for these methods were "very straightforward" and accurate.
- still no kdoc suggestions.
