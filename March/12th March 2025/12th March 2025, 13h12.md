## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue writing tests for `bookservice`: `getallbooks` and `updatebook`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- wrote test cases

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- thinking through all necessary assertions for `updatebook` â€“ ensuring all relevant fields are checked
- making sure mock setups for `updatebook` (finding the existing book, then saving the updated one) are correct.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- double-checked mockito `whenever().thenreturn()` logic.
- four more tests added to `bookservicetest.kt`.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- tests for `deletebookbyid` and start on `searchbooks` functionality in `bookservice`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- test writing for update operations requires careful consideration of what changes and what stays the same, and how the mocks should behave.
