## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin writing unit tests for `userservicetest`
- focus on `registeruser`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `userservicetest.kt` file.
- set up mockito extensions and `userrepository` mock.
- wrote test case: `registeruser_shouldsaveandreturnthenewuser()`.

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- fairly straightforward, as `userservice` crud is simpler than `bookservice`.
- ensuring the `user` model (even if just for test setup) matches what's implied by the tests (name, email, role).

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `registeruser` test drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- continue with `userservicetest.kt`: tests.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- after the complexity of `bookservicetest`, `userservicetest` feels much simpler.
