## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin writing controller tests for `bookcontroller`
- test `post /api/books` (addbook).
- prepare for the meeting at 10:30 with Prof. 

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `bookcontrollertest.kt`.
- autowired `mockmvc` and `objectmapper`.
- added `@mockbean lateinit var bookservice: bookservice`.
- wrote a test case

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- remembering all the spring test annotations and `mockmvc` syntax.
- correctly using `objectmapper.writevalueasstring()` for the request body.
- setting up `jsonpath` expressions to verify the response.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- first controller test for `addbook` drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- test `get /api/books/{id}` (getbookbyid - found/not found) and `get /api/books` (getallbooks).

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- controller tests involve a different setup than service tests. `@webmvctest` is key.
- `jsonpath` is powerful for asserting response content.
- the provided tests are a great guide for these mvc tests.
