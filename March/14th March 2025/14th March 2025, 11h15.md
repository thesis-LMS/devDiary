## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- write tests for `bookcontroller`: `get /api/books/{id}` (getbookbyid - found/not found) and `get /api/books` (getallbooks).
- incorporate the feedback from the meeting.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- wrote test cases

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- for the "not found" case in `getbookbyid`, ensuring the mocked `bookservice` throws the correct `resourcenotfoundexception` and the controller translates this to a 404 status.
- asserting the size and content of the list in `getallbooks` response.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- three more controller tests completed.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- test `put /api/books/{id}` (updatebook - found/not found) and `delete /api/books/{id}` (deletebookbyid - success/not found).

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the separation of concerns (controller mocks service) is clear in these tests.
