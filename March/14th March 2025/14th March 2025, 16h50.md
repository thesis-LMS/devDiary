## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- write tests for `bookcontroller`: `put /api/books/{id}` (updatebook) and `delete /api/books/{id}` (deletebookbyid).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- wrote test cases

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- for `delete` returning 204 (no content), ensuring no `contenttype` or `jsonpath` assertions are made on the response body.
- consistency in mocking `bookservice` methods for update/delete to either perform action or throw exception.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `andexpect(status().isnocontent())` is sufficient for delete.
- carefully matched mock setups to the provided tests.
- crud endpoint tests for `bookcontroller` are mostly done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- test `get /api/books/search` (various params) and borrow/return endpoints for `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- http status codes are an important part of controller testing (200 ok, 201 created, 204 no content, 404 not found).
- these tests define the api's behavior very clearly.
