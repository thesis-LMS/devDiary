## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- write tests for `bookcontroller`: `get /api/books/search`, `post /api/books/{bookid}/borrow`, and `post /api/books/{bookid}/return`.
- complete and review `bookcontrollertest.kt`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- wrote test cases
- reviewed all tests in `bookcontrollertest.kt`

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring correct request parameters (`.param("name", value)`) for search and borrow endpoints.
- mapping service layer exceptions (`booknotavailableexception`, `bookalreadyreturnedexception`) to appropriate http status codes (e.g., 409 conflict) in the controller tests

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `bookcontrollertest.kt` is now complete.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start writing controller tests for `usercontroller` based on `usercontrollertest.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- controller tests for search and operations like borrow/return involve more varied status codes (200, 404, 409).
- the tests clearly define how service layer exceptions should translate to api responses.
