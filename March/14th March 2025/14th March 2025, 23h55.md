## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin writing controller tests for `usercontroller`
- set up `@webmvctest` and mock `userservice`.
- test `post /api/users` (registeruser).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `usercontrollertest.kt`.
- added spring test annotations and autowired/mocked beans (`mockmvc`, `objectmapper`, `userservice`).
- wrote test case: `post_registeruser_shouldreturncreateduserandstatus201()`.

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- setup is now familiar from `bookcontrollertest`.
- ensuring the `user` dto used in the request body and `jsonpath` assertions match the structure in the reference tests.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `registeruser` controller test drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- test `get /api/users/{id}` (getuserbyid - found/not found).

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- once the pattern for controller testing is established, creating tests for similar crud endpoints becomes faster.
- `usercontroller` tests will likely be simpler than `bookcontroller` due to fewer complex operations.
