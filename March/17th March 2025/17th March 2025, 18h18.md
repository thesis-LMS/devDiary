## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- write tests for `usercontroller`: `put /api/users/{id}` (updateuser - found/not found).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- wrote test case: `put_updateuser_shouldreturnupdateduserandstatus200whenfound()`.
- wrote test case: `put_updateuser_shouldreturnstatus404whenusernotfound()`.

## tags:
 #write_tests

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring the request body for update is correctly serialized and the mocked service interaction for update (with `eq(userid)` and `any<user>()`) is set up as per the reference tests.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `updateuser` controller tests completed.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- review all tests in `usercontrollertest.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the use of `eq()` and `any()` from mockito-kotlin is important for verifying controller-service interaction with specific path variables vs more generic body objects.
- `usercontrollertest.kt` is now functionally complete based on the reference file.
