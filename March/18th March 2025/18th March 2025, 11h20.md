## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- draft the initial github actions workflow for compilation (`compile.yaml`).
- review project structure and pom.xml for any obvious needs for the workflows.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `.github/workflows/compile.yaml`.
- defined basic structure: `name: compile`, `on: push` (to main, ignoring readme/gitignore), `jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest`.
- added steps for `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-java@v3` (jdk 17, temurin).
- added step for `mvn -b clean validate compile`.

## tags:
 #build #docs

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- remembering the exact syntax for github actions workflow files.
- deciding on appropriate path exclusions for the push trigger.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- looked up github actions documentation and examples.
- `compile.yaml` drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- draft github actions workflow for test execution (`test.yaml`).

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- having basic ci checks for compilation is a good first step.
