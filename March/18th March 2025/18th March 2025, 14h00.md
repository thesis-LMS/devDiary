## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- draft the github actions workflow for test execution (`test.yaml`).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `.github/workflows/test.yaml`.
- similar structure to `compile.yaml` (`name: test`, triggers, jobs).
- maven command changed to `mvn -b compile test`.
- reviewed the `surefire-plugin` configuration in `pom.xml` to ensure tests would be picked up

## tags:
 #build #docs

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring the test workflow correctly depends on compilation or includes it. the `compile test` command handles this.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `test.yaml` drafted.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- create/review `compose.yaml` for mysql.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- separate workflows for compile and test can be useful, or combined. for now, keeping them separate
- these workflows might be crucial for verifying implementations later.
