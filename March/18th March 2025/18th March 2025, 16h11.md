## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- perform a final review of all tests written this week (`bookservicetest.kt`, `userservicetest.kt`, `bookcontrollertest.kt`, `usercontrollertest.kt`), github workflows, and `compose.yaml`.
- ensure everything is ready and accurately reflects the requirements for the implementation phases.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- conducted a final read-through of all four main test files, checking for:
    - clarity of test names.
    - completeness of assertions based on the reference files.
    - correctness of mock setups and verifications.
    - consistency in style and structure.
- briefly reviewed `architecturetest.kt` (haven't given much thought into this yet).
- reviewed `compile.yaml` and `test.yaml` for basic correctness.
- confirmed `compose.yaml` is in place.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- n/a

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- the test suite (service and controller tests) is now considered complete and ready for the implementation phases.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- manual development of the lms backend, prolly starting with `bookservice`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- this week of focused test writing has resulted in a solid specification.
- having this detailed test suite upfront should make the tdd "green" phase very clear, regardless of whether it's manual or ai-assisted ðŸ¤”
