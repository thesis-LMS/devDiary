## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin manual implementation of `bookservice.kt` to pass `bookservicetest.kt` tests.
- set up `bookservice` class, inject repositories.
- target `addbook` and `getbookbyid` methods.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `bookservice.kt`.
- created `bookrepository.kt`, `userrepository.kt`, `borrowingrecordrepository.kt` interfaces.
- added repository dependencies to `bookservice` via constructor injection.
- implemented `addbook(newbook: book): book`. ran test, passed.
- started `getbookbyid(id: uuid): book`. initial simple fetch.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring all necessary repository interfaces were created with correct initial signatures based on what `bookservice` would need.
- the `getbookbyid` test for "not found" will require adding exception handling.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- referred to `bookservicetest.kt` for mockito interactions to infer repository method signatures.
- `addbook` passes. `getbookbyid` happy path passes.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- complete `getbookbyid` (exception case) and implement `getallbooks`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- manual tdd: focus on one test, make it green, then the next.
