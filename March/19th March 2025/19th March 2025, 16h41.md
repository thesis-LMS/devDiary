- implemented `deletebookbyid` logic: check existence, then delete or throw. tests pass.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- for `updatebook`, ensuring all relevant properties from `updateddetails` are copied to the `existingbook` before saving.
- for `deletebookbyid`, ensuring the `existsbyid` check happens before `deletebyid`.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- `updatebook` and `deletebookbyid` implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing the `searchbooks` method.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the crud operations for `bookservice` are now complete.
- manual implementation of these were straightforward tbh
