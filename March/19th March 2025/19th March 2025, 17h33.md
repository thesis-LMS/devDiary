## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin implementing `searchbooks(title: string?, author: string?, available: boolean?): list<book>` in `bookservice`.
- cover searches by individual criteria.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- started `searchbooks` method.
- implemented if/else-if logic for:
    - title only search (calling `bookrepository.findbytitlecontainingignorecase`). test passes.
    - author only search (calling `bookrepository.findbyauthorcontainingignorecase`). test passes.
    - availability only search (calling `bookrepository.findbyavailable`). test passes.
- added necessary method signatures to `bookrepository.kt` interface.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- managing the conditional logic for the optional search parameters.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- tackled one condition at a time.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (maybe tomorrow) implement combined criteria search in `searchbooks` and then move to borrow/return logic.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the `searchbooks` method will have a fair bit of conditional logic.
- `bookservicetest.kt` day 1 progress is good. most of the simpler methods are done.
