## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `searchbooks` implementation in `bookservice`, specifically the combined criteria case.
- begin `borrowbook` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented the combined criteria logic in `searchbooks` (title, author, and available all present),
- added a final `else { emptyList() }` to `searchbooks` for any other unhandled combinations (though tests primarily cover specific cases).
- started `borrowbook(bookid: uuid, userid: uuid): book`.
- implemented initial fetches: `bookrepository.findbyid` and `userrepository.findbyid`, both with `orelsethrow resourcenotfoundexception`.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring the long method name for the combined search in `bookrepository` was correct.
- starting the `borrowbook` logic, which involves multiple repositories and checks.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- careful typing and cross-referencing with test for the repository method.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- continue `borrowbook`: availability check, borrowing limit check.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `searchbooks` is complete. now onto the more complex transaction-like methods.
