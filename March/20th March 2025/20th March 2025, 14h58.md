## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue `borrowbook` implementation: availability and borrowing limit checks.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- added availability check to `borrowbook`: `if (!booktoborrow.isavailable()) { throw booknotavailableexception(...) }`. test for this passes.
- added borrowing limit check: `val currentborrows = borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull(userid); if (currentborrows >= borrowing_limit) { throw borrowinglimitexceededexception(...) }`. (defined `borrowing_limit` const). test for this passes.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring the `borrowingrecordrepository.countbyuseridandreturndateisnull` method signature was added to the interface.
- correctly defining and using the `borrowing_limit` constant.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- updated repository interface.
- used a companion object constant for the limit.
- key validation checks for `borrowbook` are now implemented.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- complete `borrowbook`: book state updates and `borrowingrecord` creation.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the order of validation in `borrowbook` is important, and the tests help enforce this. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
- interacting with three different repositories in one service method requires careful thought.
