## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- complete `borrowbook` method: book state updates and `borrowingrecord` creation.
- start `returnbook` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- all `borrowbook` tests in `bookservicetest.kt` now pass.
- started `returnbook(bookid: uuid): book`.
- implemented initial fetches: `bookrepository.findbyid` and `borrowingrecordrepository.findbybookidandreturndateisnull`, with appropriate exceptions if not found/no active record.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- correctly constructing the `borrowingrecord` with all necessary fields (bookid, userid, borrowdate, duedate).
- ensuring the sequence of saves (book first, then record, or vice-versa - decided book state then record is fine for this).

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- careful object instantiation for `borrowingrecord`.
- `borrowbook` is complete and fully tested.
- initial checks for `returnbook` are in place.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- continue `returnbook`: book state updates, record updates, late fee calculation.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `returnbook` will have similar complexity with state changes and calculations.
