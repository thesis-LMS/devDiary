## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue `returnbook` implementation: book state updates, `borrowingrecord` updates, and late fee calculation.
- complete `bookservice` implementation.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- all `returnbook` tests in `bookservicetest.kt` now pass.
- ran all tests in `bookservicetest.kt` - all green!
- added kdoc stubs to `bookservice.kt` methods.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #docs 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring all entities (`book`, `borrowingrecord`) are saved after modification.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- double-checked save calls.
- `bookservice.kt` is now fully implemented and all its tests pass. kdocs added.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start manual implementation of `userservice.kt` based on `userservicetest.kt`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `bookservice` is complete for the manual phase! this took roughly the planned two days.
- the detailed tests made it very clear what needed to be done
- i should get more involved in manual coding instead of relying on LLMs lol
