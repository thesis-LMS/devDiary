## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin manual implementation of `userservice.kt` to pass `userservicetest.kt`.
- set up `userservice` class, inject `userrepository`.
- implement `registeruser` method.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- same as first day of `bokservice` implementation

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none significant. `userservice` is much simpler than `bookservice`.
- ensuring the `user` model structure used in the service matches what the tests imply.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- straightforward implementation.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `getuserbyid` method in `userservice`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- after `bookservice`, `userservice` feels like a breeze.
