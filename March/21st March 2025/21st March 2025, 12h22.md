## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `updateuser(id: uuid, updateddetails: user): user` method in `userservice`

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `updateuser`.
- logic:
    - `val existinguser = userrepository.findbyid(id).orelsethrow { resourcenotfoundexception("user with id $id not found") }`
    - `existinguser.name = updateddetails.name`
    - `existinguser.email = updateddetails.email`
    - `existinguser.role = updateddetails.role` (assuming role is updatable as per test structure, might need to verify user model)
    - `return userrepository.save(existinguser)`
- ran `updateuser_shouldupdateandreturnuserwhenfound()` - passed.
- ran `updateuser_shouldthrowresourcenotfoundexceptionwhenusernotfound()` - passed.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring all updatable fields from `user` model (name, email, role) are handled. the tests guide this.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- updated all properties as implied by the tests and a typical user update scenario.
- `updateuser` implemented and all `userservicetest.kt` tests pass.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- add kdocs to `userservice.kt`

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `userservice.kt` implementation complete. this took just under a day, much faster than `bookservice` due to its simpler domain.
- the "2 days per test file" estimate seems generous for simpler services like this one, but good for complex ones.
