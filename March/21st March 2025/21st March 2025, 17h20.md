- reviewed the `userservice.kt` implementation for clarity and correctness against tests.
- ran all tests in `userservicetest.kt` again - all green.

## tags:
 #docs #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- `userservice.kt` is now functionally complete and documented for the manual phase.

## next steps:
