## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- review both `bookservice.kt` and `userservice.kt` implementations.
- ensure all repository interfaces (`bookrepository`, `userrepository`, `borrowingrecordrepository`) have all necessary method signatures derived from service layer usage.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- read through `bookservice.kt` and its kdocs.
- read through `userservice.kt` and its kdocs.
- cross-referenced all calls to repository methods from both services and verified that each method signature exists in the corresponding repository interface file.
