## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- create stub classes for `bookcontroller.kt` and `usercontroller.kt`.
- inject service dependencies.
- plan the implementation flow for controllers based on their test files.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created `bookcontroller.kt` in `web` package. added constructor injection for `bookservice`.
- created `usercontroller.kt` in `web` package. added constructor injection for `userservice`.
- briefly reviewed `bookcontrollertest.kt` and `usercontrollertest.kt` to map out which controller methods correspond to which service calls.

## tags:
 #implement_functions #docs

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- none, just setting up the basic structure for the controller layer.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- n/a
- controller stubs are ready.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- start implementing `bookcontroller` methods to pass `bookcontrollertest.kt` tests.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- with services implemented, controllers should mostly be about mapping http requests/responses to service calls and handling http status codes.
