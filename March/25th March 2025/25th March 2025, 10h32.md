## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin manual implementation of `bookcontroller.kt` to pass `bookcontrollertest.kt`.
- set up `@restcontroller`, inject `bookservice`.
- implement `post /api/books` (addbook).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- annotated `bookcontroller` with `@restcontroller` and `@requestmapping("/api/books")`.
- constructor-injected `bookservice`.
- implemented `addbook(@requestbody newbook: book): responseentity<book>` method:
    - `val savedbook = bookservice.addbook(newbook)`
    - `return responseentity.created(uri.create("/api/books/${savedbook.id}")).body(savedbook)`
- ran `post_addbook_shouldreturncreatedbookandstatus201()` test. passed after fixing the uri creation for the location header.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- correctly creating the `location` header for the 201 created response. `servleturicomponentsbuilder` or a simpler `uri.create` can be used.
- ensuring the controller method signature matches what spring mvc expects for request mapping and body conversion.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- used `uri.create()` for simplicity in location header.
- matched annotations like `@postmapping`, `@requestbody`, `@pathvariable` to the test setup.
- `addbook` controller method implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `get /api/books/{id}` (getbookbyid) in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- controller implementation involves mapping http requests to service calls and constructing appropriate http responses (status codes, headers, body).
