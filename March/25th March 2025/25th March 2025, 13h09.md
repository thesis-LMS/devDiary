## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `get /api/books/{id}` (getbookbyid - found/not found) in `bookcontroller`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `getbookbyid(@pathvariable id: uuid): responseentity<book>` method:
    - `try { val book = bookservice.getbookbyid(id); return responseentity.ok(book) } catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.notfound().build() }`
- ran `get_getbookbyid_shouldreturnbookandstatus200whenfound()` - passed.
- ran `get_getbookbyid_shouldreturnstatus404whenbooknotfound()` - passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- deciding how to handle the `resourcenotfoundexception` from the service: either an `@exceptionhandler` method in the controller or a try-catch block. opted for try-catch for directness in this method.
- ensuring the controller returns `responseentity.notfound().build()` for 404.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- used try-catch for exception handling within the method.
- `getbookbyid` controller method implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `get /api/books` (getallbooks) in `bookcontroller`.
