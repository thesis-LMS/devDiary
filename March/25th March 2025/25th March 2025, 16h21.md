## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `get /api/books` (getallbooks) in `bookcontroller`.
- implement `put /api/books/{id}` (updatebook - found/not found).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `getallbooks(): list<book>`:
    - `return bookservice.getallbooks()` (spring handles wrapping this in a 200 ok responseentity by default if no `responseentity` is explicitly returned).
- test for `getallbooks` passed.
- implemented `updatebook(@pathvariable id: uuid, @requestbody booktoupdate: book): responseentity<book>`:
    - `try { val updatedbook = bookservice.updatebook(id, booktoupdate); return responseentity.ok(updatedbook) } catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.notfound().build() }`
- tests for `updatebook` passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- similar exception handling for `updatebook` as with `getbookbyid`.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- returned list directly for `getallbooks`.
- used try-catch for `updatebook`.
- `getallbooks` and `updatebook` controller methods implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `delete /api/books/{id}` (deletebookbyid) and start `get /api/books/search`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the controller logic for basic crud operations is becoming quite repetitive
