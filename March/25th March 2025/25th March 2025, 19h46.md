## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `delete /api/books/{id}` (deletebookbyid) in `bookcontroller`.
- start implementing `get /api/books/search`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `deletebookbyid(@pathvariable id: uuid): responseentity<void>`:
    - `try { bookservice.deletebookbyid(id); return responseentity.nocontent().build() } catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.notfound().build() }`
- tests for `deletebookbyid` passed.
- started `searchbooks(@requestparam(required = false) title: string?, @requestparam(required = false) author: string?, @requestparam(required = false) available: boolean?): list<book>`:
    - `return bookservice.searchbooks(title, author, available)`
- test for search by title passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring `deletebookbyid` returns a 204 no content status.
- correctly annotating `@requestparam` for optional search parameters in `searchbooks`.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- used `responseentity.nocontent().build()`.
- set `required = false` for search request params.
- `deletebookbyid` controller method done. `searchbooks` started and one test passes.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- (next week, monday) complete implementation and testing for `searchbooks` and the borrow/return endpoints in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `bookcontroller` day 1 complete. good progress on the crud endpoints.
