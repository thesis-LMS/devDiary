## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- continue manual implementation of `bookcontroller.kt` to pass remaining `bookcontrollertest.kt` tests.
- complete the `searchbooks` endpoint.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- reviewed `searchbooks` method in `bookcontroller` and its tests.
- ensured all `@requestparam` annotations are correct for `title`, `author`, `available`.
- confirmed the controller method simply calls `bookservice.searchbooks(...)` and returns the list.
- ran all `searchbooks` tests from `bookcontrollertest.kt` (by title, author, available, multiple criteria) - all passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- no major issues, as the service layer already handles the search logic. the controller is a thin wrapper.
- double-checking that the parameter names in `@requestparam` match the test expectations.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- careful mapping of request parameters.
- `searchbooks` endpoint in `bookcontroller` is complete and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `post /api/books/{bookid}/borrow` endpoint in `bookcontroller`.
