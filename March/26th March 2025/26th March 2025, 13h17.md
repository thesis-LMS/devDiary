## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `post /api/books/{bookid}/borrow` endpoint in `bookcontroller`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `borrowbook(@pathvariable bookid: uuid, @requestparam userid: uuid): responseentity<book>`:
    - `try { val borrowedbook = bookservice.borrowbook(bookid, userid); return responseentity.ok(borrowedbook) }`
    - `catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.status(httpstatus.not_found).build() }`
    - `catch (e: booknotavailableexception) { return responseentity.status(httpstatus.conflict).build() }`
    - `catch (e: borrowinglimitexceededexception) { return responseentity.status(httpstatus.conflict).body("borrowing limit exceeded message from exception if desired, or just conflict") }` // decided to just return conflict for now as per test structure.
- ran tests for `borrowbook` (success, book not found, user not found, book not available/conflict) - all passed after adjusting exception handling to match test's expected status codes.

## tags:

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- mapping specific service exceptions (`resourcenotfoundexception`, `booknotavailableexception`, `borrowinglimitexceededexception`) to the correct http status codes (404, 409) as defined by the controller tests.
- initially forgot the `borrowinglimitexceededexception` case in the controller.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- added specific catch blocks for each relevant exception from the service.
- ensured status codes in `responseentity` matched test expectations (e.g., `httpstatus.conflict` for business rule violations like 'not available' or 'limit exceeded').
- `borrowbook` endpoint implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `post /api/books/{bookid}/return` endpoint in `bookcontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the tests for borrow endpoint were very helpful in guiding this.
