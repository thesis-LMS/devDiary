## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- implement `post /api/books/{bookid}/return` endpoint in `bookcontroller`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `returnbook(@pathvariable bookid: uuid): responseentity<book>`:
    - `try { val returnedbook = bookservice.returnbook(bookid); return responseentity.ok(returnedbook) }`
    - `catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.status(httpstatus.not_found).build() }`
    - `catch (e: bookalreadyreturnedexception) { return responseentity.status(httpstatus.conflict).build() }`
- ran tests for `returnbook` (success, book not found, book already returned/conflict) - all passed.

## tags:
 #implement_functions 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- similar to `borrowbook`, mapping service exceptions (`bookalreadyreturnedexception`) to http 409 conflict.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- consistent exception handling pattern applied.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- review entire `bookcontroller.kt`, add kdocs, and run all its tests.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `bookcontroller` implementation is almost complete.
