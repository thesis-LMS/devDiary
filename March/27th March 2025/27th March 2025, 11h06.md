## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin manual implementation of `usercontroller.kt` to pass `usercontrollertest.kt`.
- set up `@restcontroller`, inject `userservice`.
- implement `post /api/users` (registeruser).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- annotated `usercontroller` with `@restcontroller` and `@requestmapping("/api/users")`.
- constructor-injected `userservice`.
- implemented `registeruser(@requestbody newuser: user): responseentity<user>`:
    - `val saveduser = userservice.registeruser(newuser)`
    - `return responseentity.created(uri.create("/api/users/${saveduser.id}")).body(saveduser)`
- ran `post_registeruser_shouldreturncreateduserandstatus201()` test from `usercontrollertest.kt` - passed.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- this is very similar to `bookcontroller.addbook`, so fairly straightforward.
- ensuring the `location` header uri is correct.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- reused the pattern for 201 created response.
- `registeruser` in `usercontroller` implemented and tested.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- implement `get /api/users/{id}` (getuserbyid) in `usercontroller`.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- `usercontroller` should be quicker to implement due to simpler underlying service.
- consistency in api design for crud operations makes controller implementation predictable.
