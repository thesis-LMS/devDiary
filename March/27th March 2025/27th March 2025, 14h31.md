- implement `get /api/users/{id}` (getuserbyid - found/not found) in `usercontroller`.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- implemented `getuserbyid(@pathvariable id: uuid): responseentity<user>`:
    - `try { val user = userservice.getuserbyid(id); return responseentity.ok(user) } catch (e: resourcenotfoundexception) { return responseentity.notfound().build() }`
- ran `get_getuserbyid_shouldreturnuserandstatus200whenfound()` - passed.
- ran `get_getuserbyid_shouldreturnstatus404whenusernotfound()` - passed.
