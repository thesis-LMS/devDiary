## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- thoroughly review and test the github actions workflows (`compile.yaml`, `test.yaml`).
- ensure they run correctly with the current codebase.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- reviewed `compile.yaml`: checks out code, sets up jdk 17, runs `mvn -b clean validate compile`. looks good.
- reviewed `test.yaml`: similar setup, runs `mvn -b compile test`. looks good.
- pushed the current manual development branch to a test remote (or simulated by running commands locally in a clean checkout).
- both compile and test workflows passed successfully.

## tags:
 #build 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- ensuring the maven commands are correct and that the workflows have the necessary permissions/setup if they were running on a real ci server (though for local simulation, it's simpler).

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- workflows appears correct and functional with the current codebase.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- review `compose.yaml` for docker and ensure it's aligned with project needs.
- start drafting/updating the `readme.md` for the manual implementation.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- having ci workflows, even for a thesis project, is probably good practice for ensuring code health.
