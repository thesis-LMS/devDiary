## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- review `compose.yaml` for docker (mysql setup).
- start drafting/updating the `readme.md` file for the manual development branch.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- reviewed `compose.yaml`: defines a mysql service, sets environment variables for database, user, password. ports are mapped. this is suitable for local development.
- created/updated `readme.md`:
    - added project title and brief description.
    - section on "manual development approach".
    - instructions on how to build and run tests (`mvn clean test`).
    - instructions on how to run the application with docker compose for the database (`docker-compose up -d mysql`, then run spring boot app).

## tags:
 #build #docs

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- writing clear and concise readme instructions.
- ensuring the docker compose instructions are correct for someone else (or future me) to use.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- focused on essential setup and run commands.
- initial draft of `readme.md` for manual phase is done.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- final checks and overall reflection on the manual phase.
- wrap up `readme.md`

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- a good readme will help with reproducibility.
- docker compose greatly simplifies local db setup.
