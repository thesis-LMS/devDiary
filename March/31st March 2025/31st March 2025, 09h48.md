## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- write a more detailed summary in the `readme.md` about the manual development process itself.
- reflect on challenges and time taken for the manual phase so far.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- expanded the "manual development approach" section in `readme.md`.
- detailed the tdd process followed: writing service tests, then service impl; controller tests, then controller impl.
- noted the approximate time spent on each major component (`bookservice`, `userservice`, controllers).
- summarized key challenges encountered during manual implementation (e.g., managing complexity in `borrowbook`/`returnbook`, ensuring correct exception-to-http-status mapping in controllers).

## tags:
 #docs 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- articulating the development process and challenges concisely for the readme.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- focused on providing a high-level overview suitable for someone looking at this specific implementation branch.
- `readme.md` updated with more detail on the manual process.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- tomorrow: final checks and overall reflection on the manual phase.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- documenting the process itself in the readme is helpful for context.
- reflecting on time spent and challenges helps in comparing with ai-assisted phases later.
