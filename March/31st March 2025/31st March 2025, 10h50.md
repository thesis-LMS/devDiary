## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- final overall review of the entire manual implementation.
- check for any missed comments or kdocs.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- did a quick read-through of all implemented kotlin files (`bookservice`, `userservice`, `bookcontroller`, `usercontroller`, model classes, repository interfaces).
- ensured all public methods have at least basic kdocs.
- checked for clarity of comments added yesterday.
- verified that constants (like borrowing limit, late fee) are used consistently.

## tags:
 #docs 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered: 
- just the diligence of a final pass.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- found a couple of methods where kdoc params could be more descriptive, updated them.
- codebase documentation and commenting are now in a good state.

## next steps:
what will i work on next?
- perform a final `mvn clean test` for the manual phase.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- a last check on documentation and comments ensures a polished state before moving to the next development approach.
