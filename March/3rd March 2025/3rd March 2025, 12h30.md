## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin the initial hands-on evaluation of various AI coding assistants identified as potentially relevant for the TDD "Green" phase implementation.
- this session's primary focus is on IDE-integrated tools like GitHub Copilot (Pro/Student version)
- establish a baseline feel for its interaction model and the quality of suggestions within the LMS project context.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- set up a new branch in the LMS project specifically for GitHub Copilot trials.
- ensured the predefined test suite for `BookService` is ready.
- attempted to implement the `BookService.addBook(newBook: Book): Book` method using GitHub Copilot's inline suggestions in IntelliJ IDEA.
- typed the method signature and observed Copilot's immediate suggestion for the implementation (`return bookRepository.save(newBook)`).
- ran the corresponding `addBook_shouldSaveAndReturnTheNewBook` test, which passed with Copilot's suggested code.
- tinkering around, will prolly do the same for the whole weekend lol

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- copilot suggested a generic java exception (`NoSuchElementException`) instead of the project's custom kotlin exception (`ResourceNotFoundException`) for the `getBookById` not-found scenario. this required manual correction.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manually changed `NoSuchElementException` to `ResourceNotFoundException("Book with id $id not found")` to align with test expectations. the test then passed.
- noted that Copilot's initial suggestions are fast but require immediate review for project-specific conventions and details.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- evaluate the IntelliJ AI Assistant, using the same `BookService` methods, and compare its behavior and output quality to Copilot.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- üëç
- have used Copilot before, so no surprises
