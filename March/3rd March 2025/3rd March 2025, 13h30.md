## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- evaluate the IntelliJ AI Assistant.
- compare its performance and interaction style with GitHub Copilot for the same basic TDD tasks in the LMS project.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- initial steps same as Copilot
- attempted `BookService.getBookById`. the AI Assistant also suggested a standard exception, which needed manual correction to `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- explored its context awareness. it seemed to understand the project structure within IntelliJ IDEA.
- tried prompting it via its chat interface for the `getBookById` method, explicitly asking for `ResourceNotFoundException`. the chat interface provided a more accurate snippet in this case.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- 

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- manually corrected the exception type for inline suggestions.
- used the AI Assistant's chat feature to get a more specific implementation when inline suggestions were not perfectly aligned.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- evaluate Cursor

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- intelliJ AI Assistant is also very competent for basic code generation and well-integrated.
- the built-in chat feature is a useful addition for more complex or specific queries, potentially reducing the need to switch to an external chat tool for simple refinements.
- the challenge of ensuring project-specific conventions (like custom exceptions) are followed by generic AI suggestions persists across these integrated tools. this reinforces the need for the "Refactor" step in TDD, even with AI assistance.
