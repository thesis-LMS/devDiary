## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- evaluate Qodo
- compare its behavior with the other IDE-integrated tools (Copilot, IntelliJ AI).

## activities:
tasks completed:
- similar setup as before
- prompted Qodo to implement `BookService.addBook` based on the tests. initial attempt was slow and the Qodo panel showed no result
- retried the prompt. the second attempt generated the correct simple implementation. test passed.
- prompted Qodo for `BookService.getBookById`, ensuring the relevant tests (including the not-found case with `ResourceNotFoundException`) were in its context.
- qodo generated the implementation _correctly using `ResourceNotFoundException`_ without explicit mention in the prompt for the exception type itself, seemingly inferring it from the test code.

## tags:
 #qodo #evaluation 

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- qodo's initial unresponsiveness ("often does not show result") was a significant issue and confirmed prior observations. this could be a major productivity blocker.
- the workflow of selecting context files and managing Qodo's interface within the IDE took some getting used to.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- retrying the prompt for `addBook` eventually yielded a result.
- qodo's successful inference of the custom exception type for `getBookById` from the test context is a very promising sign and aligns with its unique selling proposition.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- tomorrow, shift focus to evaluating chat-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and start the process of filtering down the tool list for the main experiment.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- qodo's ability to understand and utilize custom exceptions directly from the test context is a distinct advantage over the other IDE tools evaluated so far, which required manual correction or more explicit prompting for this specific detail. this is a strong point for TDD.
- however, what's the point if it frequently fails to generate output :/

- copilot offers speed, 
- IntelliJ AI offers solid integration with chat, 
- Cursor offers a novel AI-first environment, and 
- Qodo shows promise in test understanding despite performance issues.
