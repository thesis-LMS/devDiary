## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- begin evaluation of chat-based AI tools for TDD code generation, starting with ChatGPT (using the free tier GPT-4o model).
- assess its ability to generate Kotlin code for `BookService.getBookById` based on provided test snippets.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created a new project branch for ChatGPT evaluation.
- copied the relevant test methods from `BookServiceTest.kt` for `getBookById` (both the success case and the `ResourceNotFoundException` case) into the ChatGPT interface.
- prompted: "Implement the Kotlin function `fun getBookById(id: UUID): Book` for a Spring Boot `BookService` class. this service uses a `BookRepository`. the implementation should make the following JUnit 5 tests pass: [pasted test code]."
- chatGPT generated an implementation.
- manually integrated the code into `BookService.kt`. needed to fix the package declaration and add some imports.
- chatGPT initially used `java.util.Optional` and `orElseThrow()`, which is fine, but then threw a generic `NoSuchElementException`.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- chatGPT's initial code used `NoSuchElementException` instead of the project-specific `ResourceNotFoundException` that was clearly used in the provided test code.
- the process of copy-pasting test code into the chat and then generated code back into the IDE is cumbersome and error-prone (e.g., forgetting imports, package issues). 
- ensuring ChatGPT understands the full context (e.g., other methods in the class, specific repository interface) from just test snippets can be difficult.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- re-prompted ChatGPT: "please modify the previous solution to throw a `ResourceNotFoundException(\"Book with id \$id not found\")` when the book is not found, as shown in the test."
- chatGPT then provided the corrected version. after manual integration and import fixes, the tests passed.
- documented the need for explicit prompting for custom exceptions even when present in test context.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- evaluate Claude using the same `BookService.getBookById` task and compare its performance and interaction style.    

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- chatGPT can generate functional code based on tests, but it requires very precise prompting, 
- the manual overhead of context transfer (copy-pasting) is a significant drawback compared to IDE-integrated tools for this type of TDD task.
