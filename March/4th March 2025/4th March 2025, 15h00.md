## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- evaluate Google's Gemini (free tier, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite) for TDD code generation using the `BookService.getBookById` task.
- compare its output and interaction with ChatGPT and Claude.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- created a new project branch for Gemini evaluation.
- pasted the `BookService.getBookById` test snippets and a brief description of the `BookService` and `BookRepository` into Gemini's interface.
- prompted: "Implement the Kotlin function `fun getBookById(id: UUID): Book` for a Spring Boot `BookService`. it should use `BookRepository` and pass these tests: [pasted tests], including throwing `ResourceNotFoundException`."
- gemini generated an implementation.
- integrated the code into `BookService.kt`. required manual fixes for package and imports.
- gemini's initial code also used a generic exception. after a follow-up prompt specifying `ResourceNotFoundException`, it corrected it.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- similar to ChatGPT, Gemini's first attempt used a generic exception rather than the project-specific `ResourceNotFoundException`, despite it being in the tests and mentioned in the prompt.
- manual integration effort for package/imports.
- assessing its unique strengths compared to the other chat models for this specific TDD use case.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- used a refinement prompt to correct the exception type. tests passed after this and manual integration.
- gained a baseline understanding of Gemini's capabilities for this task.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- briefly re-evaluate 16xprompt's relevance.
- start filtering the list of AI tools and make preliminary decisions on which ones to exclude from the main thesis experiment, justifying these choices.

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- gemini's performance for this task was comparable to ChatGPT's free tier: capable of generating the core logic but needing explicit guidance for project-specific details like custom exceptions, and requiring manual effort for integration.
- claude's initial accuracy in using the custom exception without a specific re-prompt stands out so far among the chat-based tools for this particular scenario.
- the core challenge with chat-based tools remains consistent: effective context provision and the need for refinement prompts.
