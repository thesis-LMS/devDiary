## objective:
what is the goal of this session?
- briefly re-investigate 16xprompt to confirm its applicability for the thesis.
- make initial decisions on filtering the list of AI tools for the main experiment, based on the evaluations from yday and today
- justify the exclusion of certain tools to focus the study.

## activities:
tasks completed:
- **16xprompt:** conducted a quick targeted search for "16xprompt TDD" and "16xprompt code generation". information found suggests it's more of a prompt engineering tool or platform for chaining/optimizing prompts for LLMs, rather than a direct code generation assistant in the same vein as Copilot or a standalone chat model like Claude. 
	- decided it's out of scope for direct comparison as a TDD implementation assistant for this thesis.
- **tool filtering decisions & justifications:**
    - **exclude IntelliJ AI Assistant:** while competent, its core inline suggestion functionality for simple tasks felt very similar to GitHub Copilot. to avoid redundancy and focus on more distinct interaction models or specialized tools, Copilot will represent the "general-purpose IDE-integrated assistant" category more broadly due to its wider adoption.
    - **exclude Cursor IDE:** although it offers a deeply integrated AI experience, it's more of an "AI-native IDE" rather than an assistant/plugin that augments an existing, standard IDE. the thesis aims to evaluate tools that developers can integrate into common environments like IntelliJ. focusing on plugins keeps the comparison more direct.
    - **exclude Gemini (for now, for the final four):** while capable, its initial performance on the simple task was similar to ChatGPT's free tier. to keep the chat-based comparison focused and manageable, the primary comparison will be between ChatGPT and Claude, as they represent leading models with slightly different interaction styles (Claude's file uploads, different underlying models/tuning). if significant issues arise with ChatGPT or Claude during the main experiment, Gemini could be a backup to reconsider.
- **confirmed Finalists for Thesis Experiment:** GitHub Copilot, Qodo, ChatGPT, and Claude. this selection provides:
    - two IDE-integrated tools with different focuses (Copilot: general-purpose, Qodo: testing-specific).
    - two leading chat-based tools with different strengths/interaction nuances.

## challenges:
problems or blockers encountered:
- ensuring the justification for excluding tools is sound and aligns with the thesis objectives (comparing tools as _assistants_ in a typical TDD workflow).
- articulating why the selected four provide a good representative spectrum for the study.

## solutions/progress:
how were issues resolved?
- focused the selection criteria on tools that act as assistants within a standard TDD process using common IDEs, and tools that offer distinct approaches.
- the list of tools for the main experiment is now finalized: Copilot, Qodo, ChatGPT, Claude.

## next steps:
what will I work on next?
- tomorrow, continue with the manual implementation
- later, start with one of these tools and carry on the experiment

## reflection:
key takeaways, learnings, or insights:
- the initial broad evaluation phase is complete. it's crucial to narrow down the scope to make the main experiment manageable and focused.
- the selected four tools (Copilot, Qodo, ChatGPT, Claude) represent a good mix of interaction styles (IDE-integrated vs. chat) and claimed specializations (general coding vs. testing focus).
- the decision to exclude some tools is based on practical considerations for the thesis scope and the aim to compare distinct approaches rather than every available tool.
